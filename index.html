      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <p>After our discussion with Carol Blair from the Chester Square Neighborhood Association, we learned that the primary concern with
        the current MBTA bus system is its unreliability. Residents are dissatisfied with the current frequency and traffic delays of the buses.
        As a result of this meeting, in our design, we focused on assessing the delay and unreliability of the buses. We focused on the routes that pass
        through Chester Square. The problem that we wanted to solve is highlighting the areas where the buses are most delayed/unreliable, so that
        people in a position to improve the buses would have this information. From the results of our online survey emailed to residents of the
        neighborhood, it was clear that a majority felt that the buses were unreliable and sometimes delayed, so our goal was to create
        a visual that would highlight this problem. Therefore, our visualization will show users the reliability of each bus stop in Chester Square,
        and will also show users the reliability of the other stops on those bus routes which pass through Chester Square. We hope that the Chester Square
        Neighborhood Association can use this interactive visual as leverage in discussions with the MBTA administration in efforts to  facilitate change.  </p>

        What the coinciding visuals represent are a specified map of the Chester Square Neighborhood, and a local map
        of the city of boston. On the left we have a visual that has the stops placed at geographically correct coordinates
        within the chester square neighborhood. Each of the stops contains information about the stop name, and the route
        it is apart of.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the right, we have a visual that displays the bus routes that most primarily affect the Chester Square Neighborhood.
        We've identified those routes as the 1, 43, SL4, and SL5 routes, due to their proximity near the Chester Square community.

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

      <p>
        The data we needed to accomplish our goals was mostly comprised in text files that we retrieved from the MBTA GTFS data.
        Through the use of python scripts, we converted the text files into CSV files and read those files using the d3.csv method.
        Most of our analysis came from mining the data using filtering techniques, allowing us to get a better understanding of the
        particular use, and capabilities of the packaged GTFS data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The majority of our data planning and analysis was done is Tableau to give us a better understanding of the vast amounts of data.
        We were then able to create informative visuals in the software and then recreate them using Javascript. This way, we fully understood the message and story we hoped to convey with the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we initially discovered was how vast and well organized the GTFS data was, however we did realize that much of it was compartmentalized
        and we had to perform a number of joins in order to extract the exact data that we cared about. Namely, the stops around the Chester Square Neighborhood
        and the bus routes which they were apart of. After extracting this data, and pulling their associated geographical coordinates, we were able to build out some helpful visualizations.
      </p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    
      <p>
        The main objective of our visualization is to explain the unreliability of the MBTA bus system in an effective manner.
        We first gathered and parsed through data on the expected versus actual arrival times of the bus and discovered the percent of reliability
        of each bus line that travels through the Chester Square Neighborhood. This analysis shows the where the MBTA should work to improve the
        reliability and usage of the buses. We are able to show the reliability of the bus at different times of the year that could potentially
        allow for a further analysis of why buses are more unreliable at certain times of the year. Upon further exploration, changed in the bus system
        could be made at specific time of the year. Another goal of ours was to asses the traffic delays in the neighborhood for optimal bus allocation
        during rush hour and off-peak hours. In a future build, we would focus on explaining the reliability of the buses at different times of the day instead
        of for the overall day. Eventually, we would be able to come up with solutions to solving the issue of unreliable buses not only in Chester Square but in the city of Boston.

                  specifically, and the other would be on for the entire routes that the stops are apart of.

                  filtering can be done for any of the bus-routes.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>Our visualizations representing the bus routes in the Chester Square Neighborhood aim to show the reliability of each of the lines. 
        We were able to provide meaningful information through our analysis of data near and around this neighborhood. What we found is that 
        the silver lines are significantly more consistent than the other bus lines. The on-time performance of the SL4 and SL5 bus lines is 
        approximately 77% compared to the ~72% of the Route 1 bus and the ~55% of the Route 43 bus. This is significant because we are able to 
        show that the likelihood of the bus adhering to the schedule is more likely taking one of the silver line buses. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, we would hope to have specific reliability for each of the stops in the Chester Square Neighborhood. The reason for this being that the current accessible OTP scores are given to the whole route, rather than each stop. Having the score for each stop would allow us to do a more in-depth study of the stops in the neighborhood. This information can be crucial and helpful to the neighborhood for their specific transportation needs, in regards to helping predict the nature of bus schedule consistency. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, we would have liked to have actual bus schedule data as opposed to the currently scheduled data. The difference between the two is that what is currently accessible to the public is the bus schedule, and not details when the bus actually arrived at its destination (or stop). Access this data would allow us to forecast and possibly predict the bus reliability, at each stop, via similar methods to how on-time performance is calculated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future builds, we would like to have all of this data allows us to create more in-depth and comprehensive visualizations. In addition to allowing us to run a larger analysis and possibly use predictive classification methods to help garner a better understanding of the entire public transit system.
      </p>
